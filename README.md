# intSet

Your task is to define the following two methods for the in1. tSet class:

Define an intersect method that returns a new intSet containing elements that appear in both sets. In other words,

s1.intersect(s2)

would return a new intSet of integers that appear in both s1 and s2. Think carefully - what should happen if s1 and s2 have no elements in common?

2. Add the appropriate method(s) so that len(s) returns the number of elements in s.
